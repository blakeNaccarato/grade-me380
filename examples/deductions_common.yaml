# General

G1: |-  # 20 points
  You didn't use the lab report template, or else your lab report differs too much from the template to be recognizable.

G2: |-  # 4 points
  You are missing the title page, or have used an incorrect title page.

G3: |-  # 4 points
  You have made excessive grammatical errors.

G4: |-  # 4 points
  Don't include any kind of Table of Contents in your reports. This includes Table of Figures, Table of Tables, etc. I may have manually removed your TOC's to facilitate my grading of your report.

G5: |-  # 10 points
  Please don't get creative with your top-level headings. Your top-level headings must be as follows:
  - Abstract
  - Introduction and Theory
  - Procedures
  - Results and Discussion
  - Conclusion

G6: |-
  Mind your gaps. Use Ctrl+Enter to insert Page Breaks as necessary, rather than manually hitting Enter a bunch of times between sections.

  Page Breaks are invisible. Ctrl+Shift+8 will toggle invisible characters, and "Page break" will be visible wherever you have inserted them. You can also use Section Breaks, which are a similar concept.

G7: |-  # 4 points
  Use the "Heading 1" style (modify it as you see fit) for your top-level headings. This facilitates document navigation, and ensures a consistent style. I may have applied the "Heading 1" style in your report to facilitate my grading.

G8: |-
  Don't put colons at the end of your headings.

G9: |-
  Don't screenshot your Desktop. If you want to present a figure, crop it properly using the built-in Windows snipping tool (Win+Shift+S) or your PDF viewer's own snipping tool.

G10: |-
  Don't screenshot equations or type them as plain text. Instead, use Microsoft Equation Editor (Insert ribbon tab > Equation).

G11: |-  # 0 points
  Make sure you are numbering your equations. I will never take off points as long as you are numbering your equations somehow, but please see my template for an equation-numbering methodology that is more appropriate for reports like this.

G12: |-
  Equations should not appear inside a paragraph, but rather must be on their own line and numbered accordingly. An exception may be made for especially compact equations or single-term products.

G13: |-
  Avoid pictures of hand-writing. It is usually unnecessary (if scratch work) or should be converted to equations (if a derivation).

G14: |-
  Your paragraphs are indistinguishable. Either specify an indent at the beginning of your paragraphs (right-click and modify the "Normal" style to have a "first line" indent), or specify a spacing between paragraphs that makes them distinct.

G15: |-
  Avoid using multi-level lists to structure your sections. Instead use "Heading 1", "Heading 2", "Heading 3", and so on. You can modify these styles as you see fit by going to "Home" in the ribbon, right-clicking on the style of interest, and selecting "Modify".

  Multi-level lists are not an appropriate way to structure your report, as you end up with successively further indented paragraphs.
  If you can't figure this one out, just check/use the Lab Report Template!

G16: |-
  Avoid bulleted or numbered lists, or other formats similar to a bulleted list. Instead, describe in paragraph form.

G17: |-
  Figures are missing captions (e.g. "Figure 1: Description of figure"). Check the Lab Report Template.

G18: |-
  Don't wrap text around your figures, as if in a storybook. Rather, figures should be on their own line. I know this can look bloated, especially for narrow pictures. You may use composite figures where you have a few items indicated in a figure. The caption could reflect the parts of the figure like (a), (b), (c), etc.

G19: |-
  Make sure that your figures are "in line with text". If you see a little floating anchor when you select your figure, then you're creating more trouble for yourself than it's worth! It is difficult to keep a figure and its caption together when they are "floating" like this. Please use "in line with text" figures and keep them with their captions.

G20: |-
  Tone is too conversational. Saying things like, "I don't know" or mentioning issues as if discussing directly with the instructor. Instead, try to find the source of your issues so that you can discuss it professionally in the text.

G21: |-
  Properly source things. Saying "figure taken from lab manual" is not an appropriate way to cite your source. Rather, you may use a tag like [1] that coincides with source [1] in your references, or some other appropriate parenthetical citation of your choosing.

G22: |-
  Avoid pictures of hand-writing. It is usually unnecessary (if scratch work) or should be converted to equations (if a derivation).

G23: |-
  Don't write separate reports for each exercise. Instead, your Introduction and Theory should have all exercises in it, then your Procedures should have all exercises in it, and so on. Work to discuss the interrelated concepts between exercises in any lab that has multiple exercises.

G24: |-  # 0 points
  I see that you are manually pressing tab/spacebar in order to flush your equation numbers to the right-side margin. The equation editor actually natively supports flushing to the margin. Try it out!

  - Type your equation as usual.
  - Type "#" without leaving the equation box
  - Type your equation number without leaving the equation box
  - Hit Enter

  Your equation will be centered, and the equation number will be automatically flushed to the right-hand margin without you having to manually space it out.

  Alternatively, you could exit the equation box, put a right-aligning tab in the ruler at the end of the line, then tab over to get your equation number flushed to the right.

G25: |-
  Don't wrap text around your figures, as if in a storybook. Rather, figures should be on their own line. I know this can look bloated, especially for narrow pictures. You may use composite figures where you have a few items indicated in a figure. The caption could reflect the parts of the figure like (a), (b), (c), etc.

G26: |-
  Fractional units within paragraphs are better-conveyed linearly, not stacked. Toggle superscript with Ctrl+Shift+=, subscript with Ctrl+=, and use "-" (dash) to separate units (e.g. J/kg-K means "Joules per kilogram Kelvin").

  You can also get Equation completions outside of equation fields by going to
    File > Options > Proofing > AutoCorrect Options > Math AutoCorrect
  and ticking the box for "Use Math AutoCorrect rules outside of math regions". This will give you the \cdot operator which you can use in place of "-" (dash) if you like. This also gives you quick access to Greek characters without having to go to Insert > Symbol.

G27: |-
  Building schematic-type figures directly in your document with shapes and lines is a recipe for disaster. Each shape has its own floating anchor point, moving the figure is a nightmare, and it rarely looks that good. Instead, try building your figure on a blank PowerPoint slide, then copying the elements over to Word, clicking the clipboard menu popup (tap Ctrl straight away after pasting to get there), and selecting "Picture" (Ctrl, then U, not Ctrl+U).

G28: |-
  Don't use centered paragraphs. Left-align or justify your paragraphs.

G29: |-
  Make sure your tables don't spill over the margins.

G30: |-
  Your report has inconsistent styling.

G31: |-
  Don't use "*" or a dot to indicate multiplication in equations. Multiplication is implicit when two terms are side-by-side, e.g "ab".

G32: |-
  Instead of defining variables like this, say it like, “where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, …” etc. It should be in paragraph form.

G33: |-  # 0 points
  Your equations are perhaps a little too spaced out.

# Abstract

A1: |-  # 4 points
  Make sure to include a numerical result or two (especially a summarizing result) to back up claims made in your abstract.

A2: |-  # 4 points
  Don't just list all of your numerical results. Instead, make a claim in the Abstract and back it up with a result or two.

A3: |-
  Don't have headings in your Abstract. Rather, summarize main takeaways in a single paragraph or two.

A4: |-
  Abstract is not the proper length. Abstracts should not be overly-long relative to the rest of the report, nor should they be too short.

A5: |-
  Your abstract should not have tables or figures. It is a paragraph-form summary of the major takeaways from the experiment.

# Introduction and Theory
# Procedures

P1: |-
  Don't worry about listing out every single little piece of equipment. Instead, address equipment in paragraph form as needed.

# Results and Discussion

R1: |-
  Please discuss results as you go, rather than all at once at the end. This results in a more natural flow of the discussion.

R2: |-  # 4 points
  'Human error' is insufficient rationale for percent error calculations between experimental measurements and theoretical values. 'Human error' is a form of systematic error, which is not generally an 'acceptable' form of error. Please do identify any systematic errors you made in your experiment, but also list possible contributions to 'random error', those unmeasured variations in the environment that affect your measurements.

R3: |-
  If you want to have actual tables in your report (as opposed to images of tables), here is a tip for keeping them from breaking across pages:
  - Select the entire table (click the "move" handle that appears at the top-left to quickly select it all)
  - Go to the "Home" tab in the ribbon
  - Click the "overflow" arrow next to "Paragraph"
  - Click on the "Line and Page Breaks" tab
  - Check the box for "Keep with next"

  This will make each row of the table "follow" the next row to the next page if need be.

R4: |-
  Tables are just screenshots. Follow the advice in the tutorial "Copy-Paste Tables from Excel to Word (4 min)" in the "Lab Report Writing Resources" module.

R5: |-
  There is illegible font in figures/tables/charts. When you are embedding a plot in your report, check that all the fonts visible in the chart are about the size of the document text. At the very least, font in figures should not be smaller than the document text.

R6: |-
  Even if your particular percent error is very low, you should still discuss possible contributions to error.

R7: |-
  An overly-large table is in your Results and Discussion when a summary table would've been better. You can include full-fledged tables in the Appendix, but try to reduce the data for presentation in the main body of your report. Once way to do this is by taking averages of multiple trials, or by breaking up the table into multiple, smaller, easy-to-digest tables. Also, sometimes there is enough data to warrant plotting it and showing the chart instead.

  You can use a Query Table to further digest an overly-long regular (blue-colored) Table. Use the same approach seen in the Excel tutorial "How-To, Lab 2 Query and Pivot Tables (14 min)", skip to 2:30 to see how a larger table can be chopped down to be more manageable.

R8: |-
  Any line that you draw on a chart should be meaningful. Certain Excel chart types or chart features draw lines that are not inherently meaningful.

  You should not "connect the dots" of charts as in the "Scatter with Lines and Markers" and "Scatter with Smooth Lines and Markers" chart styles in Excel. This is because each "dot" represents a single measurement, and an arbitrary line drawn between a dot and its neighbor is not a meaningful relationship. We can't say for sure what happens between "dots", because we didn't take measurements at those points. Less is more when it comes to representing data as a chart.

  Linear regression lines are sometimes meaningful, but only if the regression is justified by your physical interpretation.

  Remember that Excel is primarily a business data tool. We have co-opted it for engineering reports due to its ubiquity, but the defaults are not always meaningful to an engineering audience.

# Conclusion

C1: |-
  No major revelations should be made in the Conclusion. You don't make "new" conclusions here, but rather reiterate the main conclusions you reached in the Results and Discussion section. See the "Rubric.pdf" in "Lab Report Resources" on the "Files" tab.

C2: |-
  Conclusion is not the proper length. Conclusions should not be overly-long relative to the rest of the report, nor should they be too short.
